  <h1>College:</h1>       
  <div class="description">
    <p>&emsp;College is one of the more direct passage to post-grade school curriculum. There, one can learn how to be an amazing mathematician or obtain a certificate to write books. Although, college is a completely optional path, it is greatly advised by all in an effort to raise students' specialization. We exist in a world in which the well-paying jobs required a higher area of expertise not taught in high school. This is the chief reason for why colleges are deemed by many to be essential and was correlated with "good life". Here, I listed 3 very viable options for computer science students. However, it may not correspond with everyone's interest. In such circumstances, please follow this link to the <a href="https://www.collegeboard.org/" target="_blank" class="normalLink">CollegeBoard</a>.</p><br>
    <p>&emsp;*Note: Price is calculated on the assumption of lodging at school. Housing and food can be quite expensive.</p>

  <h1>FAFSA:</h1>       
  <div class="description">
    <p>&emsp;Although college is one of the more direct passage to post-grade school curriculum, it can be quite expensive. Thus, the US government set out a pool of money to fund scholarships. FAFSA, which stand for Free Application for Federal Student Aid, is an option scholarship waiting to be pick up. They say there are no free lunch. That is quite true. FAFSA is funded by tax money, but a large portion does originated from obese wallets. Will you apply for FAFSA?

  <h1>Military:</h1>       
  <div class="description">
    <p>&emsp;Although college is one of the more direct passage to post-grade school curriculum, military is an excellent alternative. For a college student, they must must rely heavily upon scholarships and their parents' assistance to finish their courses. Even then, they will kick off with a rocky road, having accumulated quite a large debt. For a military trainee, one will be maintaining a consistent salary as they defend bravely for the country. Which is quite ironic because one does not fight in era of peace, which it is for our silent West Coast. When joining the military, I will advise further research for it can and it will determine your training. The first weeks will be tough, but survive it and they just might send you to college for free! Afterall, even military jobs can be quite specialized and with great veteran benefits.
