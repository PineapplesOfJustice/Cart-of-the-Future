  <h1>Credit Score: A number</h1>

        <p>&emsp;What is the importance of this 3 digit numbers, one may ask. Credit Score, also known as risk score, is a number used by virtually all financial agents to measure the trustworthiness, or untrustworthiness, of a person financially. Ranging anywhere from 300-850, the credit score is one of the many factors that can determine one's eligibility to buy expensive luxuries and/or receive 5 digits loans. In a abstract sense, it is the equivalent to an academic grade. Just as one may want straight As to enroll in a college, a high credit score is vital in requesting loans. You donâ€™t need that A+, but a passing C is still quite mandatory. Anything lower and there will be trouble.
</p><br><br>
      <p>&emsp;The benefits of having a high credit score, preferably 600<sup>+</sup>, include, but not limited to, low down payment, APR, and trust from banking companies. It is inconvenience to carry around a pocket of cash and dangerous, too. In such circumstances, we utilizes the credit card. The magical, swipable plastic card that allow one to loan money from the bank for something as trivial as mall shopping. Of course, one have to repaid it by month's end or risk accumulation from a steep interest. It must be note that having a high credit score can dampen the interest somewhat. Not only that, high credit can raise the limit in which the credit card can be use. Beyond that limit, a penalty will be invoked, thus, the ceiling matter. The point here is that high credit score build trust with banks and financial agents, who in turn reward with benefits and laxation on rules.  
</p><br><br>
      <p>&emsp;On the other hand, a low credit score is devastating. Having low credit, one will observe more than just inablility to use credit cards and get loans. Finding jobs have increased difficulty for employers want responsible employees. And good financial record is one way to demonstrate that. Quite problematic when one have low credit score. Another unfortunate effect include high utility bills and house mortage. It is simply vicious. When someone don't trust you, they can and will beat you down. My advice, keep a good credit score.

         <p>&emsp;So credit meant trust, but what create or affect it? There are two major systems of evaluation: <a href="http://www.fico.com/" target="_blank" class="normalLink">FICO</a> and <a href="https://www.vantagescore.com/" target="_blank" class="normalLink">VantageScore</a>. Both used the 300-850 score range with 5 major components. 1) payment history. If you have shown capability to repaid debt, shark loaners like that. After all, who will lend money to a friend that won't pay it back? Not me anyhow. 2) amount owed, or debt. It is much more difficult to repay debt when it is filling to the ceiling. Hence, most college students made it first priority to paid off their educational loans. 3) length of history. Lengthy ones give a much better average. When there are little history, creditors may assume the worse no matter the actual score. 4) new credit -meaning accounts-. The easiest way to gain credit is to use a credit card. Demonstrate one's ability to repaid loan and credit will soar. However, rapid initiation of accounts is counter-productive in that it lower credit score. Why? Companies are unaware of your capability to micro-manage multiple account and that fear is overdriving. 5) credit diversity. Having a great diversity is beneficial, but it must not be forced. Each new credit account can and will impact the original history, possibly even damaging it. It is great caution to only use credit that is necessary. And make sure that you check your credit score often. Possibly with <a href="https://www.creditkarma.com/" target="_blank" class="normalLink">Credit Karma</a>.</p>

    <p>&emsp;Let's be truthful. Only a handful of parents will let their chidren inititate new credit cards. And often with supervision, so then, how can one obtain credit? Well, one must be 18 years of age and working to be able to request a credit card. However, co-sharing a credit card with a guardian or parent is possible as early as the age of 15. Using this method, one's credit history will accumulate without possibly even touching anything moneywise. But note that any missing payments on your parents behalf likewise will reflect in your credit history. Although it is efficient, the question remain. Will your parents trust you to be responsible not overspend it? Ah, there is the word again. "Trust". Without "trust", there will not be credit. Without "trust", one cannot take loans, or buy fancy sport cars. "Trust" is important, don't let it die on you. Be someone who can be trusted.</p>
