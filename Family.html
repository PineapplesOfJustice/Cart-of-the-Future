  <h1>Relationship:</h1>       
  <div class="description">
    <p>&emsp;Laugh now, but one day you will get married, whether you like it or not. Just kidding, but seriously, consider it. Having a relationship can make all the difference in how one view life. Having someone to depend upon is essential in hard times and that trust is irreplacable as a source of happiness. I will never advocate divorce, but sometime it happen and sometime it must happen. This is your life. Live it to its greatest potential, but you must not play with the feelings of others. That is the sacred rule, which must not be broken.</p>

          <p>Sweet forever ever after. I hope one will not have to break up in the near future. What made up the cost? It will be shopping expenses. After all, the other's wages will be used for one lifestyle and monthly bills. Yup, shopping can be quite expensivo.</p><br><br>

  <h1>Children:</h1>       
  <div class="description">
    <p>&emsp;This isn't a blog about the birds and the bees, so we will skip those PG-13 scene. Children are nuisances, they break vases, get on one's hairs, and kept one away from the paradise of sleep. But, they are amusing and will cheer one up in the later years. When we grew old and frail and bedridden, I don't want to be alone. The emptiness of the house that seem to echo at each and every corner. Children, be they adopted or birthed can make all the difference in a homely home. For names suggestion, follow this link, to the <a href="https://www.babble.com/baby-names/" target="_blank" class="normalLink">Babble</a> website. Hmm, Frederick sound like a fine name.</p>

  <h1>Pets:</h1>       
  <div class="description">
    <p>&emsp;Whereas some prefer children to keep their company, others prefer to keep a pet. More expensive, less rewarding, that is what a pet is. But they are all the company that some people need to peak up their bleak lives. Animals don't appeal to me, but it does to others. They don't really have a purpose in life, except to eat, sleep, and live. My rambling asides, you are free to keep one.

          <p>Raising goldfishes is painless and money-wise. Goldfish only need clean water and daily exposure to food. If one can do those two things, then one can raise a goldfish. It is a good pet for children who should not be around dogs. But, there isn't as much joy in comparison.</p><br><br>

          <p>Man's best friend? Also called canine, like the teeth. A dog require very expensive medical care and plenty of love. Just like having another human being in the house. However, they still have relatively low understanding of the world in comparison with an 8 year-old child.</p><br><br>
