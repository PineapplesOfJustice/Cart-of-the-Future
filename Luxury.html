    <p>&emsp;My mom I hate car, my dad love car, and I am just eh. I don't love to drive, but I can see why it is necessary. To get to places quicker and carry those heavy loads. It is hard to push around them 20 lbs bag of rice from the supermarket to home. But in the perfect world, ,car will not the exist. They produce harmful CO<sub>2</sub>, which lead to greenhouse effects. Woo, I feel hotter already. This is why, I prefer electric cars like Tesla. They are not guilt free, but the energy production is at least cleaner in comparision to gasoline.

  <h1>Insurance:</h1>       
  <div class="description">
    <p>&emsp; Tradgedy happens and to lessen their impact, one can buy insurances. That may or may not include any of the selection below, but one is required by federal law to have insurance. Insurance is a monthly "investment" (they just target your salary), and will return a huge sum whenever the requirements are met. Most companies hope that the requirements will never be met, but that is beside the point. Insurance can be categorized into home, life, auto, and etc. Literally anything can have insurance, but auto insurance is the most commonly provided by essentially all companies. This is one website that briefly explain <a href="http://understandinsurance.com.au/insurance-explained" target="_blank" class="normalLink">insurance</a>.<br>&emsp;Anyhow, the terms used by professional can be confusing so here are a few. "Deductible" is the amount that one must pay before the insurance chip in. Best to have it low. "Coinsurance" is the amount that the insurance will chip in (in percent). "Copayment" is the amount you have to paid after the insurance covered some of it (in dollar). "Insurance Policy" is the terms and conditions of the contract. "Insurance Premium" is how much you paid to the insurance each month. AKA: The income of the insurance company. So yeah, that is the basics. There are others, but it is best for me to leave it <a href="http://www.naic.org/consumer_glossary.htm" target="_blank" class="normalLink">Naic.org</a> because it can be quite lengthy.</p>
